## Nexus Layer 1

The Nexus Layer 1 is a planetary-scale blockchain supercomputer that:

- Concentrates compute power into a single chain
- Scales horizontally with each new node
- Scales vertically with the Nexus zkVM
- Creates a unified proof of all computation: the Proof Singularity

### Network Configuration

```json
{
  "chainId": "393",
  "rpcUrl": "https://rpc.nexus.xyz/http",
  "wsUrl": "wss://rpc.nexus.xyz/ws",
  "explorerUrl": "https://explorer.nexus.xyz"
}
```

## Nexus zkVM

The Nexus zkVM is a modular, extensible, open-source zkVM written in Rust, focused on performance and security.

Key features:
- Proves any computation with zero-knowledge proofs
- Open source with no proprietary components
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Security-focused design

Simple proving workflow:

```bash
cargo nexus prove
cargo nexus verify
```

### The Evolution of Verifiable Computation

Nexus is pioneering the development of general-purpose verifiable compute models through its zkVM evolution:

#### Nexus zkVM Versions

| Version | Release | Key Advancements | Performance Gain |
|---------|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| 0.0     | Initial | First general-purpose zkVM | Baseline |
| 1.0     | 2023    | Parallel proving, optimized circuits | 10x |
| 2.0     | 2024    | Multi-core acceleration, specialized hardware support | 100x |
| 3.0     | Coming soon | Distributed proving, novel cryptographic primitives | 1000x+ |

This exponential performance improvement represents a new type of **Moore's Law for verifiable computation**. While traditional computing follows Moore's Law of doubling transistor density approximately every two years, Nexus's zkVM technology is advancing at an even more accelerated pace, with each generation delivering order-of-magnitude improvements in proving speed, cost efficiency, and computational capacity.

These advancements are enabling entirely new categories of applications that were previously impractical due to performance constraints, from real-time verifiable AI inference to complex financial systems with instant settlement and verification.

## Zero-Knowledge Research

### History of Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) represent one of the most significant breakthroughs in modern cryptography, enabling one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

**Timeline of Major Developments:**

- **1985**: The concept of zero-knowledge proofs is introduced by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff in their seminal paper ["The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof Systems"](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf).

- **1988**: The first practical zero-knowledge protocols are developed, including the Fiat-Shamir heuristic for converting interactive proofs to non-interactive ones.

- **1992**: Introduction of probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs), laying groundwork for future successes in verifiable computation.

- **2010-2012**: Development of zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge), making ZKPs more practical for real-world applications.

- **2016**: Zcash launches as the first widespread application of zk-SNARKs in a cryptocurrency.

- **2019-Present**: Explosion of research in recursive proof systems, transparent setups, and performance optimizations leading to practical zkVMs.
